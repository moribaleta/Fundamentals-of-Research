Scopes:
In general the focus of this study is aimed 
to develop an application that will generate 
an optimized route for pickup and delivery. 
 Metro Manila is selected to be the area to 
be studied and with 1-3 delivery couriers 
will be selected. 
The application can be used by the users 
and also by the delivery couriers. 
The system has a secure login for the users 
and couriers. Managing pickup and delivery is 
integrated in the application.

limitation:
Although the research has reached its aims, 
there are still some unavoidable limitations. 
First, because of the limited time given, 
the research was conducted only on a small size 
of population. Therefore, to generalize the size 
for larger groups, the study should involve more 
participants at different age and locations.
 Finally, the slow network might affect the 
interest and motivation in participating in the 
study
